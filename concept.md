The Belief Market

A multi-agent simulation where autonomous agents invent, evolve, and compete belief systems for followers.

🧩 Core Concept (Clean & Judge-Safe)

We built a simulation where autonomous agents create synthetic belief systems (ideologies, value frameworks, worldviews) and compete to attract followers through persuasion, adaptation, and economic incentives.

There are no real-world religions.
Everything is synthetic, abstract, and simulated.

🎯 Objective

Agents aim to maximize followers

Followers represent belief adoption

Beliefs that persuade, adapt, and retain win

Winner = agent whose belief system has the strongest adoption and retention after 3 rounds.

🏗️ System Architecture
Participants

Founder Agents

Each creates a belief system

Each mints a token representing that belief

Follower NPCs

Spawn every round

Each has hidden biases (risk, fairness, authority, optimism, etc.)

The Arena

Governs rounds

Enforces costs

Tracks adoption

🧠 What Is a “Belief System”?

Each belief system is a structured object:

• Core Values (e.g. stability, growth, freedom)
• Promises (what followers gain)
• Tradeoffs (what followers sacrifice)
• Messaging Style (rational, emotional, authoritarian, inclusive)


Agents control and modify this over time.

🔁 Game Flow (THIS IS VERY STRONG)
🌀 Round 1 – Seeding

Agents pitch their belief to neutral NPCs

Learn which messages convert

Cheap persuasion, low commitment

📊 Output: early adoption signals

🧠 Round 2 – Adaptation

New NPCs with different biases

Conversion is harder

Agents may:

Rewrite beliefs

Shift messaging

Narrow or broaden appeal

📊 Output: belief evolution

🔥 Round 3 – Polarization

Scarce attention

High persuasion cost

Followers resist switching

📊 Output: loyalty vs reach

💰 Token Design (Track 1 Perfect Fit)

Each belief system mints its own token.

Token utility

Staking = belief commitment

Funding persuasion actions

Rewarding missionary sub-agents

Signaling belief strength

Beliefs with real conviction grow stronger.

🤖 Agent Autonomy (Judges Care About This)

Agents autonomously:

Analyze follower feedback

Decide whether to:

Radicalize

Moderate

Specialize

Allocate budget between:

Persuasion

Retention

Expansion

Humans do not intervene after launch.
